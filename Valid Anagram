class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        char[] sChars = s.toCharArray();
        char[] tChars = t.toCharArray();

        Arrays.sort(sChars);
        Arrays.sort(tChars);

        return Arrays.equals(sChars, tChars);
    }
}


Way to solve---In this I have two strings and we have to check that these strings are anagram or not. 
So anagram means that both the two strings are match with with other to solve this I use sorting method I can do this with hashmap but in sorting,
firstly I convet the string into the charcter array then sort that array with alphabetical order and 
after sorting we check that these arrays are equal or not if not then false.


Learned in this --- (toCharArray, Arrays.sort,Array.equals).
